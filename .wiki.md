# Project Summary
Anonimax.com is an anonymous messaging platform that enables secure communication while preserving user anonymity. It integrates the Session app for messaging and allows cryptocurrency payments. Users can create profiles linked to their Session ID and preferred cryptocurrency wallet, receiving a unique Anonimax ID for authentication. Recent updates have introduced subscription plans for posting listings, direct messaging capabilities, and cryptocurrency payments directly from user profiles, supporting BTC, ETH, USDT, and USDC. A new pricing page has been added to facilitate these subscription services.
