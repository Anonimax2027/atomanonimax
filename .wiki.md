# Project Summary
The Anonimax project is a decentralized platform designed for anonymous communication and cryptocurrency transactions. It allows users to create anonymous profiles, interact securely through a messaging service, and conduct transactions using cryptocurrencies like BRZ, USDT, and others. The platform emphasizes user privacy, ensuring no personal data is required for account creation or transactions.

# Project Module Description
- **Authentication Module**: Handles user registration, login, email verification, and password recovery.
- **Profile Management**: Users can create and update their anonymous profiles, manage crypto details, and save favorite profiles.
- **Listings Module**: Users can create, view, and manage service or product listings, including payment processing.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Admins can manage users, listings, payments, and view platform statistics.
