# Project Summary
Anonimax.com is an anonymous messaging platform that allows users to communicate securely while maintaining complete anonymity. It integrates the Session app for messaging and supports cryptocurrency payments. Users can create profiles linked to their Session ID and preferred cryptocurrency wallet address, receiving a unique Anonimax ID for authentication and service listings. Recent updates have added functionality for direct messaging and cryptocurrency payments from user profiles.

# Project Module Description
The project consists of several functional modules:
- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration processes.
- **Profile Management**: Users can create and manage profiles with their Anonimax ID and Session ID.
- **Listing Management**: Users can create, view, and filter service listings.
- **Search Functionality**: Users can search for profiles and services using Anonimax IDs.
- **Anonymous Messaging**: Integration with Session for secure messaging.
- **Cryptocurrency Integration**: Support for various cryptocurrencies for transactions.
- **Direct Interaction**: New buttons for "Discuss" and "Pay" have been added to facilitate communication and payments directly from user profiles.
