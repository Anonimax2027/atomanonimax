# Project Summary
Anonimax.com is an anonymous messaging platform designed for secure communication while ensuring user anonymity. It integrates the Session app for messaging and facilitates cryptocurrency payments. Users can create profiles linked to their Session ID and preferred cryptocurrency wallet, receiving a unique Anonimax ID for authentication. Recent enhancements include direct messaging capabilities and the option to make cryptocurrency payments from user profiles, specifically supporting BTC, ETH, USDT, and USDC. A new guide has been added to assist users in installing the Session app and retrieving their Session ID.
